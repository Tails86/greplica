# greplica

A grep clone in Python with both CLI and library interfaces, supporting ANSI color coding and more.

## Known Differences with grep

- The -D, --devices option is not supported and no support is planned. All inputs are handled as
file streams only, and there is no way to adjust this.
- Context cannot be given as raw number -NUM.
- The Python module `re` is internally used for all regular expressions. The inputted regular
expression is modified only when basic regular expressions are used. See --help for more
information.

## Installation
This project is uploaded to PyPI at https://pypi.org/project/greplica/

To install, ensure you are connected to the internet and execute: `python3 -m pip install greplica`

Once installed, there will be a script called `greplica` under Python's script directory. If `grep`
is not found under PATH, then a script called `grep` will also be installed. Ensure Python's script
directory is under PATH to be able to execute the script properly from command line.

                [EXPRESSIONS] [FILE [FILE ...]]

Reimplementation of grep command entirely in Python.

positional arguments:
  EXPRESSIONS           Expressions to search for, separated by newline character (\n). This
                        is required if --regexp or --file are not specified.
  FILE                  Files or directories to search. Stdin will be searched if not
                        specified, unless -r is specified. Then current directory will be
                        recursively searched.How directories are handled is controlled by -d
                        and -r options.

Expression Interpretation:
  -E, --extended-regexp
                        EXPRESSIONS are "extended" regular expressions. In this mode,
                        greplica passes regular expressions directly to Python re without
                        modification. This for the most part matches original "extended"
                        syntax, but be aware that there will be differences.
  -F, --fixed-strings   EXPRESSIONS are strings
  -G, --basic-regexp    EXPRESSIONS are "basic" regular expressions. In this mode, greplica
                        modifies escaping sequences for characters ?+{}|() before passing to
                        Python re. This for the most part matches original "basic" syntax,
                        but be aware that there will be differences.
  -P, --perl-regexp     EXPRESSIONS are "perl" regular expressions. In this mode, greplica
                        passes regular expressions directly to Python re without
                        modification. This for the most part matches original "perl" syntax,
                        but be aware that there will be differences.
  -e EXPRESSIONS, --regexp EXPRESSIONS
                        use EXPRESSIONS for matching
  -f FILE [FILE ...], --file FILE [FILE ...]
                        take EXPRESSIONS from FILE
  -i, --ignore-case     ignore case in expressions
  --no-ignore-case      do not ignore case (default)
  -w, --word-regexp     match whole words only
  -x, --line-regexp     match whole lines only
  --end END             end-of-line character for parsing search files (default: \n); this
                        does not affect file parsing for -f or --exclude-from
  -z, --null-data       same as --end='\0'

Miscellaneous:
  -s, --no-messages     suppress error messages
  -v, --invert-match    select non-matching lines
  -V, --version         display version information and exit
  --help                display this help text and exit

  -m NUM, --max-count NUM
                        stop after NUM lines
  -b, --byte-offset     print line's byte offset with each line
  -n, --line-number     print line number with each line
  --line-buffered       flush output on each line
  -H, --with-filename   print file name with each line
  -h, --no-filename     suppress the file name output
  --label LABEL         use LABEL as the standard input file name
  -o, --only-matching   show only nonempty parts of lines that match
  -q, --quiet, --silent
                        suppress all normal output
  --binary-files TYPE   sets how binary file is parsed; TYPE is 'binary', 'text', or
                        'without-match'
  -a, --text            same as --binary-files=text
  -I                    same as --binary-files=without-match
  -d ACTION, --directories ACTION
                        controls how directory input is handled in FILE; ACTION is 'read',
                        'recurse', or 'skip'
  -r, --recursive       same as --directories=recurse
  -R, --dereference-recursive
                        same as --directories=recurse_links
  --include GLOB [GLOB ...]
                        limit files to those matching GLOB
  --exclude GLOB [GLOB ...]
                        skip files that match GLOB

  -l, --files-with-matches
                        print only names of FILEs with selected lines
  -c, --count           print only a count of selected lines per FILE
  -T, --initial-tab     currently just adds tabs to each sep value (will make better later)
  -Z, --null            adds 0 to the end of result-sep
  --result-sep SEP      String to place between header info and and search output
  --name-num-sep SEP    String to place between file name and line number when both are
                        enabled
  --name-byte-sep SEP   String to place between file name and byte number when both are
                        enabled

                        print NUM lines of output context
  --color [WHEN], --colour [WHEN]
                        use ANSI escape codes to highlight the matching strings; WHEN is
                        'always', 'never', or 'auto'
  -U, --binary          do not strip CR characters at EOL (MSDOS/Windows)
  ```

## Library Help

greplica can be used as a library from another module. The following is a simple example.
```py
from greplica.grep import Grep

grep_obj = Grep()
grep_obj.add_expressions('hello .*ld')
grep_obj.add_files('file1.txt', 'path/to/file2.txt', 'path/to/directory/')
grep_obj.directory_handling_type = Grep.Directory.RECURSE
data = grep_obj.execute()
print(data['files']) # Prints filepaths where match found
print(data['lines']) # Prints the matching lines
print(data['info']) # Prints information lines like when binary file matches
print(data['errors']) # Prints error lines like when permission denied
```

The following describes initialization arguments to Grep.
```py
__init__(self, out_file=None, err_file=None, default_in_file=None)
  '''
  Initializes Grep
  Inputs: out_file - a file object to pass to print() as 'file' for regular messages.
                     This should be set to sys.stdout if writing to terminal is desired.
                     Writing to file is skipped when this is set to None. (default: None)
          err_file - a file object to pass to print() as 'file' for error messages.
                     This should be set to sys.stderr if writing to terminal is desired.
                     Writing to file is skipped when this is set to None. (default: None)
          default_in_file - default input file stream used when no files added.
                     This should be set to sys.stdin if reading from terminal is desired by default.
                     An exception will be caused on execute() if this is None and no files added.
                     (default: None)
  '''
```

The following methods may be called to add expressions, file paths, and globs.
```py
add_dir_exclude_globs(self, *args)
  '''
  Skip directories that match given globs.
  '''

add_expressions(self, *args)
  '''
  Adds a single expression or list of expressions that Grep will search for in selected files.
  Inputs: all arguments must be list of strings or string - each string is an expression
  '''

  '''
  Skip files that match given globs.
  '''

add_file_include_globs(self, *args)
  '''
  Limit files to those matching given globs.
  '''

add_files(self, *args)
  '''

  to a file or directory. Directories are handled based on value of directory_handling_type.
  Inputs: all arguments must be list of strings or string - each string is a file path
  '''

clear_dir_exclude_globs(self)

clear_expressions(self)
  '''
  Clears all expressions that were previously set by add_expressions().
  '''

clear_file_exclude_globs(self)

  '''
  Resets all Grep state values except for the out_file, err_file, and default_in_file.
  '''
```

The following method executes using all data set above.
```py
execute(self, return_matches=True)
  '''
  Executes Grep with all the assigned attributes.
  Inputs: return_matches - set to True to fill in data as described below
  Returns: a dictionary with the following key/values:
              'files': list of matched files
              'lines': list of matched lines or [] if return_matches if False
              'info': list of information lines or [] if return_matches if False
              'errors': list of error lines or [] if return_matches if False
  Raises: ValueError if no expressions added
          ValueError if no files added and no default input file set during init
