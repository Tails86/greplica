# greplica
A grep clone in Python with both CLI and library interfaces, supporting ANSI color coding and more.

## Known Differences with grep

- The -D, --devices option is not supported and no support is planned. All inputs are handled as
file streams only, and there is no way to adjust this.
- Context cannot be given as raw number -NUM.
- The -P, --perl-regexp option is currently not supported, but support may be added in the future.
- The -T, --initial-tab option currently doesn't work as well as it does in grep.
- The Python module re is internally used for all regular expressions. The inputted regular
expression is modified only when basic regular expressions are used. See --help for more
information.

## Development Roadmap

Future planned work includes the following:

- Try to support perl regex syntax
- Fix tab option
- Optionally return matching lines when Grep.execute() is called from a library

                [EXPRESSIONS] [FILE [FILE ...]]

Reimplementation of grep command entirely in Python.

positional arguments:
  EXPRESSIONS           Expressions to search for, separated by newline character (\n). This
                        is required if --regexp or --file are not specified.
  FILE                  Files or directories to search. Stdin will be searched if not
                        specified, unless -r is specified. Then current directory will be
                        recursively searched.How directories are handled is controlled by -d
                        and -r options.

Expression Interpretation:
  -E, --extended-regexp
                        EXPRESSIONS are "extended" regular expressions. In this mode,
                        greplica passes regular expressions directly to Python re without
                        modification. This for the most part matches original "extended"
                        syntax, but be aware that there may be differences.
  -F, --fixed-strings   EXPRESSIONS are strings
  -G, --basic-regexp    EXPRESSIONS are "basic" regular expressions. In this mode, greplica
                        modifies escaping sequences for characters ?+{}|() before passing to
                        Python re. This for the most part matches original "basic" syntax,
                        but be aware that there may be differences.
  -e EXPRESSIONS, --regexp EXPRESSIONS
                        use EXPRESSIONS for matching
  -f FILE [FILE ...], --file FILE [FILE ...]
                        take EXPRESSIONS from FILE
  -i, --ignore-case     ignore case in expressions
  --no-ignore-case      do not ignore case (default)
  -w, --word-regexp     match whole words only
  -x, --line-regexp     match whole lines only
  --end END             newline character lines will be parsed by (default: \n)
  -z, --null-data       same as --end='\0'
